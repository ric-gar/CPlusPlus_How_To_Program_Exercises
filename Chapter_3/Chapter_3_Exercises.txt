Description: Chapter 3 Exercises

3.1
a) class. 
b) .h
c) type, parameter name
d) data-member.
e) access specifier.
f) void
g) getline 
h) #include

3.2
a) False. Function naming convention uses camel case. 
b) True
c) True
d) False. Data members declared in a member function are local variables. 
e) True
f) True

3.3 
A local variable has limited scope and can only be accessed in the block that it is
declared in. Data members can be accessed by all the member functions in the 
respective class. 

3.4 
Function parameters specify additional information the function needs to perform its
task. Parameters exist in function declerations and arguments exist in the function
call.

3.5 
A default constructor is implicitly called when creating an object of a class that 
does not define a constructor. The default constructor, in regards to data members,
will not initialize the fundamental data types, but will call the default 
constructor of the data-member objects. 

3.6 
Their purpose is to store the attributes of a class. Data members are variables that 
are defined in the class but outside the body of a function. They exist before, 
during, and after member functions execute. 

3.7 
A string can utilize a using declaration (using std::string;) or prefix string with
std:: to use string without inserting a using directive. 

3.8 
The set and get functions are used to encapsulate and protect the information stored 
in data members. Set functions are used to validate the arguments and reject
invalid information. Get functions are used to customize the output of data members
while protecting the information stored.
