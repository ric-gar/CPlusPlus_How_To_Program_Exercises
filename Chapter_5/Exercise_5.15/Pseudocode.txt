-Top-

Display the four triangle patterns on page 206 using only
cout << '*';
cout << ' ';
cout << '\n';


--First Refinement--

Print triangle part a
Print newline character(s) for spacing
Print triangle part b
Print newline character(s) for spacing
Print triangle part c
Print newline character(s) for spacing
Print triangle part d
Print newline character(s) for spacing


--Second Refinement--

for loop (unsigned int counter{1}; counter <= 10; ++counter)
	for loop (unsigned int innerCounter{1}; innerCounter <= counter; ++innerCounter)
		Print asterisk
	Print newline character

Print newline character


for loop (unsigned int counter{1}; counter <= 10; ++counter)
	for loop (unsigned int innerCounter{10}; innerCounter >= counter; --innerCounter)
		Print asterisk
	Print newline character

Print newline character


for loop (unsigned int counter{1}; counter <= 10; ++counter)
	for loop (unsigned int innerCounter{1}; innerCounter < counter; ++innerCounter)
		Print space
	for loop (unsigned int innerCounter{10}; innerCounter >= counter; --innerCounter)
		Print asterisk
	Print newline character

Print newline character


for loop (unsigned int counter{1}; counter <= 10; ++counter)
	for loop (unsigned int innerCounter{10}; innerCounter > counter; --innerCounter)
		Print space
	for loop (unsigned int innerCounter{1}; innerCounter <= counter; ++innerCounter)
		Print astersik
	Print newline character
