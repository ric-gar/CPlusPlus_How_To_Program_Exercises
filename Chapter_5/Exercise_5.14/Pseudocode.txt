Calculate the compound-interest application to support interest rates of
5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, and 10%.


--First Refinement--

Initialize variables
Calculate compount-interest
Print results


--Second Refinement--

Set floating-point format to two decimal places

for loop (initialize counter to unsigned int 5; from 5 to 10 (inclusive); increment counter by 1)

	Initialize principal amount to double 1000.00
	Initialize interest rate value to double counter / 100.0

	Print display header

	for loop (initialize unsigned int year to 1; from year to 10; increment year by 1)

		Calculate compound-interest for each year

		Display the year and amount
