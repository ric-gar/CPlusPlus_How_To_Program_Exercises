Calculate the value of pi, using the infinite series formula, in tabular format,
and up to 200,000 terms.


--First Refinement--

Set precision accuracy
Print table header
Calculate the infinite series for each term


--Second Refinement--

Set precision to decimal point with 15 accuracy

Initialize double variable pi to zero

Print term # with field witdth of 6
Print "Pi approximation" with field with of 20
Print newline character

for loop from 1 to 200,000 (inclusive)
(unsigned int term to 1, denominator to 1; term <= 200,000; ++term, denominator += 2)

	Print term variable with a field width of 6

	if term is odd
		pi += 4.0 / denominator
	else
		pi -= 4.0 / denominator

	Print pi with a field width of 20

	Print newline character
