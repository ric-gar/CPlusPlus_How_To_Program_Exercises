Find the smallest integer
Print the result


--Second Refinement--

Prompt the user enter how many integers followed by the integers
Initialize number of integers (numIntegers) to zero
Read input and give value to number of integers

Initialize counter to 0
Initialize smallest to integer maximum value
Initialize integer value entered to someInt

while counter is less than number of integers

	Give input value to entered integer value (someInt)

	if someInt is less than smallest
		assign someInt to smallest

	increment counter

Print the smallest value
