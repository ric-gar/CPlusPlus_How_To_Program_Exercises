Description: Input miles driven and gallons used. Calculate the MPG and total MPG.
			 Print the results.


-Top-

Calculate the miles per gallon for each trip and the total MPG.


--First Refinement--

Initialize variables, input their values, check if overflow occurs
Calculate MPG and total MPG
Print results


--Second Refinement--

Initialize miles driven to zero
Prompt user to enter miles driven (possible sentinel value)
Read input and give value to miles

Initialize total miles and total gallons to zero

while sentinel value is not entered
	check if arithmetic overflow occurs for total miles
	Add miles to total miles
	
	Initialize gallons to zero
	Prompt user to enter gallons
	Read input and give value to gallons

	check if arithmetic overflow occurs for total gallons
	Add gallons to total gallons

	Calculate MPG and print the results to six decimal digits
	Calculate total MPG and print the results to six decimal digits

	Prompt user to enter miles driven (possible sentinel value)
	Read input and give value to miles
