Estimate the value of mathematical constant e


--First Refinement--

Prompt user for desired accuracy
Calculate constant e
Print the result


--Second Refinement--

Prompt user for desired accuracy
Declare number of terms variable as integer (numTerms)
Read input and give value to numTerms

Initialize constant e double variable to 1 (eConstant)

while number of terms is greater than 1
	
	Initialize factorialTerms to (numTerms - 1)
	Initialize factorialSum to 1

	while factorialTerms > 1
		Set factorialSum to factorialSum * factorialTerms

		decrement factorialTerms to terminate loop

	add to e constant 1 / factorialSum

	decrement number of terms to terminate loop

Print the constant e value to desired accuracy
