Determine if three nonzero values can represent the sides of a triangle.


--First Refinement--

Prompt user to enter three values and read input
Check if they can represent the sides of a triangle
Print the result


--Second Refinement--

Prompt user to enter the first value
Declare variable firstEntry
Read input and give the value to firstEntry

Prompt user to enter the second value
Declare variable secondEntry
Read input and give the value to secondEntry

Prompt user to enter the third value
Declare variable thirdEntry
Read input and give the value to thirdEntry

Initialize bool variable isTriangle to false

if firstEntry + secondEntry > thirdEntry
	if firstEntry + thirdEntry > secondEntry
		if secondEntry + thirdEntry > firstEntry
			Set isTrinagle to true

if sides are a triangle
	Print that the sides can be a triangle
else
	Print that the sides can't be a triangle
