Description: Pseudocode for Exercise 4.16


-Top-
Calculate the salary of an employee for hourly and overtime pay.


--First Refinement--

Initialize variables
Read input for hours worked and hourly rate
Calculate salary
Print results


--Second Refinement--

Initialize hours worked to zero (int)
Prompt user to enter the number of hours worked (possible sentinel value)
Read input and give value to hours worked

while sentinel value is not entered

	Prompt user to enter hourly rate
	Read input and give value to hourly rate

	Print the salary, to two decimal places, using a conditional operator (hours worked is <= 40)
		If conditional operator is true print hours worked * hourly rate
		Else conditional operator is false print (hourly rate * 40) + (hourly rate * 1.5 * (hours worked - 40))

	Prompt user to enter the numbers of hours worked (possible sentinel value)
	Read input and give value to hours worked
