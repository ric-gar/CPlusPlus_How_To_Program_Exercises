Print the decimal equivalent of a binary integer


--First Refinement--

Prompt, declare variable, and read input
Calculate the binary numbers decimal equivalent
Output the result


--Second Refinement--

Prompt user to enter binary value
Declare binary variable
Read input and give value to binary variable

Initialize decimal variable to zero

if binary variable mod 10 is equal to 1
	Set the decimal variable to 1

Remove the rightmost bit from binary value

Initialize power of two variable to 2 (base 2)

While binary value is greater than zero

	if binary value mod 10 is equal to 1
		Set the decimal variable to (decimal + power of two)

	Remove the rightmost bit from binary value

	Set power of two variable to (power of two * 2)

Print the decimal value
