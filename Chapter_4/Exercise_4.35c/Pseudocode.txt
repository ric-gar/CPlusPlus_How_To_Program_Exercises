Calculate e^x with a desired accuracy entered by the user


--First Refinement--

Prompt user for x value to solve e^x
Prompt user for desired accuracy
Calculate e^x
Print results


--Second Refinement--

Prompt user for x value
Declare integer variable (x)
Read input and give value to x

Prompt user for desired accuracy
Declare integer variable (numTerms)
Read input and give value to numTerms

Initialize double variable to 1 (ex)

while number of terms is greater than 1

	Initialize squared terms (squaredTerms) to (numTerms - 1)
	Initialize squared sum (squaredSum) to 1

	while loop until squared terms > 0

		squaredSum = squaredSum * x

		decrement squared terms to terminate loop

	Initialize factorial terms (factorialTerms) to (numTerms - 1)
	Initailize factorial sum (factorialSum) to 1

	while factorial terms > 1

		Set factorialSum to factorialSum * factorialTerms

		decrement factorial terms to terminate loop

	Calculate e^x by e^x + squared sum / factorial sum

	decrement number of terms to terminate loop

Print e^x
